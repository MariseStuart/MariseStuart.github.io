    <h1>DBC/EDA experience</h1>
    <h2>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?  This is an exciting programme that will provide keen, motivated people with a great opportunity to develop skills as a software engineer is an abbreviated amount of time (in comparison to university degrees)
        What are your impressions?  That the experience of EDA is up to the user and that person's ability to apply themselves to do the work to learn.  It is possible to fail for lack of effort, and lack of commitment.  There is a strong emphasis on teamwork through the paired coding work, and this is to prepare participants for real world jobs where teamwork is essential.
    How do you see yourself enaging with this type of culture?  I am an extrovert majority of the time, and I thrive on team work and applying myself in team settings.  Hence I find it more difficult in foundation where I am doing work alone! 
Have your expectations of EDA changed, if so how?  My expectations have heigtened somewhat.  It was refreshing to hear the calibre of talent attending the academy in the US.  I had already heard about the calibre of talent in NZ and the kinds of jobs that people might go into.  It is incredibly exciting to be learning with the academy. 
Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?  I am excited to be in this learning environment for the team aspects mentioned above.  I am nervous about potentially being a bit slower than other people, as it is taking me time to get familiar with different websites, going between github, terminal, VS and waffle, but I am getting better!!</h2>
